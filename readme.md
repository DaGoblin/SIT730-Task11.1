# (EWS)Emergency Water Shutoff System with Leak Detector

This is my final project for SIT730 - Embedded Systems Development, the EWS System.

[Artefact Report.pdf](/ArtefactReport.pdf) has a deatield breakdown of the systesm, how to build your own and why it exisits, but in short the system monitors how long water has been running or if a remote sensor detects a leak and cut's off the water supply hopefully limiting the damage to your home or business.
